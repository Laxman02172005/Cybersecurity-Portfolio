## ⚠️ Common Network Threats

| Threat Type | Summary |
|-------------|---------|
| **Viruses** | Malicious code requiring user interaction; damages files or systems. |
| **Worms** | Self-replicating malware; spreads automatically across networks. |
| **Trojans** | Disguised as legitimate software; enables backdoor access. |
| **Phishing** | Social engineering to steal credentials or financial info (via email, SMS, etc.). |
| **Ransomware** | Encrypts user files and demands ransom for access. |
| **Spyware** | Secretly gathers user info and tracks activities. |
| **Adware** | Pushes intrusive ads; can slow down systems and reduce privacy. |
| **Rootkits** | Conceals malware presence and grants admin-level control. |
| **Botnets** | Networks of compromised devices used for attacks (e.g., DDoS). |
| **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)** | Intercepts communications; steals or alters data in transit. |
| **DoS / DDoS** | Overloads systems with traffic to disrupt services. |
| **APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats)** | Stealthy, long-term attacks on high-value targets. |

## 🔐 Network Defense Concepts

### 🔥 Firewalls

Firewalls are the first line of defense between trusted and untrusted networks.

**Types:**
- **Packet Filtering:** Filters based on IP, port, protocol.
- **Stateful Inspection:** Tracks active connections.
- **Proxy Firewall:** Acts as a go-between for user and destination.
- **Next-Gen Firewall (NGFW):** Includes deep packet inspection, intrusion prevention, etc.

### 🔒 Encryption

Protects data confidentiality during storage and transmission.

**Types:**
- **Symmetric (AES, DES):** Same key for encryption/decryption.
- **Asymmetric (RSA, ECC):** Public/private key pairs.
- **Hashing (SHA-256, MD5):** Ensures data integrity.

## 🛠️ Secure Network Configuration Techniques

- **Network Segmentation**: Limits threat spread by dividing the network.
- **Access Control (ACLs, VLANs)**: Restricts data access to authorized users/devices.
- **Secure Protocols (HTTPS, SSH, VPNs)**: Encrypts data during transit.
- **Patch Management**: Regular updates to address known vulnerabilities.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Real-time visibility into suspicious activity.
- **Intrusion Detection and Prevention (IDPS)**: Detects and blocks unauthorized activity.

## 📣 Cybersecurity Education & Awareness

Educating users is as critical as technical controls.

- Use **real-life examples** (e.g., phishing emails, ransomware attacks).
- Share tips like:
  - Strong, unique passwords
  - Enabling **multi-factor authentication**
  - Avoiding suspicious links/downloads
- Promote **secure Wi-Fi** use and software updates

## 🎯 Key Takeaway

Understanding both the **threat landscape** and **defensive practices** empowers individuals and organizations to protect digital assets and minimize cyber risk.
