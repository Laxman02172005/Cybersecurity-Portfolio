## 📚 Project Description  
This project demonstrates a **penetration test using Nmap** to identify open ports, running services, and vulnerabilities on a target host. The assessment covered service detection, vulnerability scanning, and risk analysis.  

The goal of the project was to showcase how a security analyst can leverage Nmap to uncover potential weaknesses, assess risk levels, and provide actionable recommendations for remediation.
