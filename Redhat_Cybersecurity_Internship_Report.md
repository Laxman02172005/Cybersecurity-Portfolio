# 🔐 Network and Web Application Security – Internship Summary

**Intern:** Mudapaka Sailaxman  
**Organization:** The Red Users  
**Duration:** 1 Month  
**Report:** [Redhat_Cybersecurity_Internship_Report.pdf](./Redhat_Cybersecurity_Internship_Report.pdf)

---

## 🧭 Overview

During my internship at **The Red Users**, I was engaged in practical, hands-on tasks focusing on two core domains of cybersecurity:

1. **Network Security Basics**
2. **Web Application Security**

This experience helped reinforce theoretical knowledge through active implementation using industry-standard tools and real-world scenarios.

## 🧱 Task 1: Network Security Basics

### 🎯 Objective
To understand and implement fundamental network security practices, identify threats, and use tools to monitor and analyze network behavior.

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Wireshark** – Packet capture and analysis  
- **Windows Defender Firewall** – Network access control and policy enforcement

### 🧠 Skills Applied
- Basic Network Security Configuration  
- Threat Identification  
- Packet Inspection  
- Firewall Rule Configuration

### 📝 Work Description

#### ✅ Threat Research
- Researched and documented common network threats:
  - **Viruses**
  - **Trojans**
  - **Phishing**
  - **Worms**

#### ✅ Security Implementation
- Configured a basic network setup using a home lab or virtual environment.
- Set up **Windows Defender Firewall** to control inbound and outbound connections.
- Applied best practices like:
  - Changing default passwords
  - Enabling **WPA2/WPA3** encryption

#### ✅ Traffic Monitoring
- Used **Wireshark** to:
  - Capture HTTP, DNS, TCP, and UDP traffic
  - Detect unusual or potentially malicious traffic
- Documented observations with **screenshots** and technical explanations

#### ✅ Key Findings
- Implemented rules significantly reduced exposure to unauthorized traffic
- Identified security gaps and proposed enhancements such as:
  - VPNs for remote access
  - Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
  - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

## 🌐 Task 2: Web Application Security

### 🎯 Objective
To explore common web vulnerabilities using real-world testing tools and scenarios.

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- **OWASP ZAP** – Web vulnerability scanning  
- **WebGoat** – Deliberately insecure web application

### 🧠 Skills Applied
- Vulnerability Discovery  
- Manual Exploitation  
- Web Application Testing

### 📝 Work Description

#### ✅ Setup & Exploration
- Installed and configured **WebGoat** locally
- Analyzed application structure and attack surfaces

#### ✅ Vulnerability Testing
- Ran automated scans using **OWASP ZAP**
- Identified:
  - **SQL Injection**
  - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
  - **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**

#### ✅ Manual Exploitation
- Inserted SQL queries to bypass login screens
- Injected malicious scripts to trigger XSS pop-ups
- Manipulated sessions to demonstrate CSRF flaws

### ✅ Mitigation Suggestions
- Input validation and sanitization
- Use of secure coding practices (parameterized queries)
- CSRF tokens and same-origin policies
