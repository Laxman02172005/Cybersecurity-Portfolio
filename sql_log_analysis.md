## 📚 Project Description  
This project demonstrates how SQL can be applied to **cybersecurity investigations** by filtering and analyzing login attempts and employee records. The queries were designed to detect suspicious login activity, investigate specific incidents, and identify employee groups for targeted security updates.  

Through this project, I showcased the ability to translate **business and security needs into SQL queries**, a valuable skill in SOC and cybersecurity analyst roles.
